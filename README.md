This is a very cool pokedex that i use to learn new stuff related to React & Automation testing.

Client (UI) use was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Backend is based on [Express & ES6 REST API Boilerplate](https://github.com/developit/express-es6-rest-api)
